Simple Process Document

This document describes a basic user registration process:

1. User enters their email and password
2. System validates the email format
3. If email is invalid, show error message and go back to step 1
4. If email is valid, check if email already exists in database
5. If email exists, show "email already registered" error and go back to step 1
6. If email doesn't exist, create new user account
7. Send confirmation email to user
8. Display success message to user
9. Process complete

This is a simple workflow that can be converted into a flowchart.
